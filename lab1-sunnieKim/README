This is the readme file for lab1c

---------------------------------
1. Notes on implementation of simpsh:

the unit of time in our output is in microseconds.

To obtain the CPU time usage of a code block, we call getrusage() at the beginning the block and at the end of the block. Then we got the difference of the two in user time and in system time.

When there is file flags(trunc, creat ...etc) appended before file options(rdonly, wronly, rdwr), we calculated them together and generate one line of output.

in --command, we ouput only the time usage of the main process.
in --wait, we output the time usage of the sum of all child processes.

------------------------------------
2. Benchmarks:

For all benchmark, we created some big files using the following command:

dd bs=8M count=8 </dev/urandom >a
dd bs=8M count=8 </dev/urandom >b
dd bs=8M count=8 </dev/urandom >c
dd bs=8M count=8 </dev/urandom >d

//note: the test cases for simpsh, execline, and shell are essentially the same just in different format.

We created a program "prime" that takes an number argument and find the next prime number. This is made so that we can compare primarly the user CPU time in one of our benchmark (#2). prime.c file is included in the folder and "prime" executable file can be generated with make.

benchmark for shell: 
# 1
time sort a | cat b - | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' > c
# 2
time ./prime 5004424555403 > c
# 3
time cat a | sed 's/a/\n/g' > c

benchmark for simpsh:
# 1
./simpsh --verbose  --profile --rdonly a --pipe --pipe --wronly c --wronly d --command 0 2 6 sort - --command 1 4 6 cat b - --command 3 5 6 tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' --wait
# 2
./simpsh --verbose --profile --rdonly a --append --wronly b --append --wronly c --command 0 1 2 ./prime 5004424555403 --wait
# 3
./simpsh --verbose --profile --rdonly a --pipe --wronly c --wronly d --command 0 2 4 cat --command 1 3 4 sed 's/a/\n/g'


benchmark for execline:
Note: export the PATH before executtion:
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cs/execline-2.1.4.5/bin

# 1 
time redirfd -w 1 c pipeline sort a "" pipeline cat b - "" tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'
# 2
time redirfd -w 1 c ./prime 5004424555403
# 3
time redirfd -w 1 c pipeline cat a "" sed 's/a/\n/g'

3. Result and Comparison:

please refer to lab1cResults.pdf

--------------------------------
4. Data Collection
we collect user CPU time and kernel system CPU time

--------------------------------
5. Conclusion

Our results for simpsh and bash are really close. This imply that simpsh is about as efficient as bash.
As we can see in #1, execline seems to finish faster than bash and simpsh. However, this is only because the "time" command only records the time it take to finish the parent process. That is,
$ time pipeline pro1 "" pro2 
only records the time of pro2.
