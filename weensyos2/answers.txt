Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is: Round Robin

(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 
	turnaround time for proc 1 is 320*4 - 3 ms 
	turnaround time for proc 2 is 320*4 - 2 ms
	turnaround time for proc 3 is 320*4 - 1 ms
	turnaround time for proc 4 is 320*4ms
	Average turnaround time is (320*4*4 - 6)/4 = 1280 - 1.5 ms = 1278.5ms

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
	turnaround time for proc 1 is 320*1 ms 
	turnaround time for proc 2 is 320*2 ms
	turnaround time for proc 3 is 320*3 ms
	turnaround time for proc 4 is 320*4 ms
	Average turnaround time is (320*(10))/4 = 800 ms

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
	wait time for proc 1 is 0ms 
	wait time for proc 2 is 1ms
	wait time for proc 3 is 2ms
	wait time for proc 4 is 3ms
	Average wait time is (0+1+2+3)/4 = 6/4 = 1.5ms

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
	wait time for proc 1 is 0ms 
	wait time for proc 2 is 320*1ms
	wait time for proc 3 is 320*2ms
	wait time for proc 4 is 320*3ms
	Average wait time is (0+320*6)/4 = 480ms


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit?
BOTH!

Exercise 5:

The first clock interrupt occurs in process 4. During the 5th cycle, '4' is not printed. 
Therefore it must be because the timer is up and interrupt is issued. 

(Exercise 6 is a coding exercise)


Anything else you'd like us to know:

Instead of having the application run process 1 on start, I modified the code so that the 
application call schedule() on start. (This way it makes more sense when using priority scheduling methods.)
